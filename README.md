# Hiten Patel - Northcoders frontend project

## Project summary:

This project is a webpage about board games and their reviews. The user can interact with this webpage by searching for reviews, voting on them, posting comments and more. These requests are sent to an API, so the webpage user can update and receive information from the API's web server in real time, and see the effect of their interaction immediately.

## Setup:

### Step 1: Install dependencies

Type the following command into your terminal:

- npm install

This will install every dependency you need to run this project

### Step 2: Set up the backend:

This project will be making use of an API. A link to the hosted version: https://northcoders-backend-hiten.herokuapp.com/api. Click on this link and take a look at the endpoints this project will be using. If you are curious about how this API works, you can find more details in the READ ME in this API's repository, which you will find here: https://github.com/galthop/be-nc-games.git.

### Step 3: Run locally:

Run "npm start" in your terminal

## Requirements:

To run this locally you will need versions: You will need at least v16.13 of Node.js and at least v12.9 of Postgres

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
